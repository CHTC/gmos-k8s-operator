                              When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
